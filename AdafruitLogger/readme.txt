AdafruitLogger.ino will run on a Leonardo, Mega, or 328 Arduino with an Adafruit
Data Logging shield with no jumper wires.

It will timestamp files.

I have included the libraries I used with the sketch.  

The version of SdFat is 20121219 with LEONARDO_SOFT_SPI and MEGA_SOFT_SPI
set to one in SdFatConfig.h
